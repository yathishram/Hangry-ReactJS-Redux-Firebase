          Hey! Noice to see you venturing here to know more about this website. Hangry is a React app created as a part of Codemonk Assignment. This webapp lets
          users signup and search for some mouthwatering yet maybe simple recipes and try them out. Also the users have the ability to create their own cookbook
          (sort of!) and edit them as they like.
